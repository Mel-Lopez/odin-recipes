This is a small project creating a recipe web page, I will use only HTML and showcase what my html skills.

The recipe page showcases three recipes that are popular from Peru, my home country. It displays the image of the dish, as well as the ingredients and steps to cook them, using unordered and ordered lists. I made sure to use alts for the images. There is currently no CSS, so it is a simple page with no styling currently.
