        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Papa rellena, translating to "stuffed potato," is delicious comfort food, combining mashed potatoes with ground beef. A seasoned ground beef filling, similar to an empanada filling, is enveloped in a layer of mashed potatoes, which is then formed into an oblong oval shape and deep-fried until it's golden brown and crispy. Kids love this meal, especially with ketchup on the side. Here's what you need.</p>

                <li>For Assembling and Frying:</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour, for dusting, or more as needed</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make the Mashed Potatoes</li>
                        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the unpeeled potatoes until they are tender when pierced with a fork, about 25 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Once the potatoes are cooked, drain them in a colander.</li>
                        <li>When they are cool enough to handle, peel and mash the potatoes thoroughly (or pass them through a potato ricer).</li>
                        <li>Season the mashed potatoes with salt and pepper to taste. Chill the potatoes uncovered for several hours, or overnight.</li>
                        <li>Once the potatoes are very cold, stir the egg into the mashed potatoes until well mixed.</li>
                    <li>Make the Filling</li>
                        <li>Cook the egg in boiling water until hard-boiled and set aside.</li>
                        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet. Add the onions, garlic, and aji pepper and cook until soft and fragrant.</li>
                        <li>Add the cumin and paprika and cook 2 minutes more, stirring.</li>
                        <li>Add the ground beef and cook until browned.</li>
                        <li>Add the beef broth and the raisins and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes more, or until most of the liquid is gone.</li>
                        <li>Stir in the green olives, if using.</li>
                        <li>Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Remove from the heat and let cool.</li>
                        <li>Peel the hard-boiled egg and chop it into about 6 pieces.</li>
                    <li>Assemble and Cook</li>
                        <li>With floured hands, place about 1/4 cup of mashed potatoes in one hand, and make a well in the center.</li>
                        <li>Fill the well with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the beef mixture and a piece of hard-boiled egg.</li>
                        <li>Mold the potatoes around the beef, adding more potato if necessary to fully enclose the filling. Shape into an oblong oval with slightly pointy ends, about the size of a medium potato.</li>
                        <li>Repeat with the rest of the ingredients; you should be able to make 6 croquettes. Coat each papa rellena generously with flour.</li>
                        <li>In a deep skillet or deep-fat fryer, heat 2 inches of oil to 360 F. Set the oven to 200 F.</li>
                        <li>Fry the potatoes in batches until they are golden brown.</li>
                        <li>Drain them on a plate lined with paper towels. Keep the papa rellena warm in the oven until ready to serve.</li>
                </ol>
